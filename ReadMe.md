# [WIP] retinaface4j
## Because not all production environements can be in python
RetinaFace (RetinaFace: Single-stage Dense Face Localisation in the Wild, published in 2019), in java.  
This repo is an experiment attempting to answer the question : Is pytorch java + ND4J a viable option for deep learning on the JVM ?
